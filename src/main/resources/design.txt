PURPOSE
---------

Build a webapp that tests the performance of data structures in the Java
Collections framework.

---------
UI LAYER
---------

The UI layer's primary component is a graph. This will plot the input size
against the time it takes to execute a given action.

Graph - Some JavaScript graph API.
    Y-axis: Time of execution
    X-axis: Input size

Input - Standard HTML. Dropdowns for collections and operations. A number
field for input size n.

Submit - Standard HTML. A submit button.

---------
REST LAYER
---------

The REST layer will require a few endpoints.

POST api/collection/test/

The payload will contain the collection, operation, and inputSize. Returns
the results of the tests with input from 1 to n.

GET api/collections

A service to return the collections available for test.

GET api/operations

A service to return the operations available for test.

DESIGN NOTES
-----------

Testing Collections --

Need to map each operation to a method. We need to put this info somewhere. Maybe a properties file?
